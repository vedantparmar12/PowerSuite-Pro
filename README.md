## ✨ Why Skills are Superior to MCP

Based on Claude's Agent Skills architecture, these skills offer significant advantages over Model Context Protocol (MCP):

### 🚀 **Performance Benefits**
- **Progressive Disclosure**: Only loads relevant content when needed (3-level architecture)
- **Context Efficiency**: Skills metadata consumes ~100 tokens, full content loaded on-demand
- **No Context Pollution**: Unlike MCP, unused skill content doesn't consume context window

### 🔧 **Architectural Advantages**  
- **Filesystem-Based**: Skills exist as directories with organized structure
- **Executable Scripts**: Code runs via bash without loading into context (infinite code capacity)
- **Intelligent Loading**: Claude automatically determines which skills are relevant

### 🎪 **User Experience**
- **Universal Availability**: Works across Claude API, Claude Code, and claude.ai
- **Automatic Activation**: Skills trigger automatically when relevant to user requests
- **No Setup Required**: Once installed, skills work seamlessly without configuration
